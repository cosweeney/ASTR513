# Likelihood is from eBOSS DR16: S. Alam et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08991

# The BAO+full shape likelihood for BOSS DR12 LOWZ and LRG samples.
# You must cite these references if you use the likelihood:
# Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR12:
# Galaxies (zeff = 0.38, 0.51): S. Alam et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.03155
# eBOSS DR16: S. Alam et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08991

# Note from the eBOSS DR16 BAO-plus README
# If you are using BOSS DR12 results (as you should) *only* use the likelihood for first two redshift bins.
# The eBOSS results combine with BOSS results for z > 0.6. The first two BOSS DR12 results
# span 0.2 < z < 0.6 (split into 0.2 < z < 0.5 and 0.4 < z < 0.6). For user convenience, the BOSS DR12 results
# corresponding to these two redshift bins have been extracted and are provided bundled with this DR16 release.
# The fsigma8(z) values are slightly different that those from the BOSS release, as we have applied a rescaling
# factor that accounts for the maximum likelihood for the geometrical factors, relative to the template used to
# extract the fsigma8(z) values. See the appendix of Alam et al. (2020) for more details.
