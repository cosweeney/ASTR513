# Likelihood is from eBOSS DR16: S. Alam et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.08991
# https://svn.sdss.org/public/data/eboss/DR16cosmo/tags/v1_0_1/
# MontePython version by V. Poulin & T. Brinckmann

# The BAO+full shape likelihood for the SDSS DR7 Main Galaxy Sample (MGS),
# designed to be independent from BOSS (z < 0.2), is based on C. Howlett et al. (2015)
# and was provided to BOSS by Cullan Howlett via private communication.
# It combines the post-reconstruction estimate of D_V/r_d with fs8.

# You must cite this reference if you use the likelihood:
